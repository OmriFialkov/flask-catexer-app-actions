# üê∂ Dog Gif App

## Overview
This project presents a **Flask-based dockerized web-app** integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation. The app dynamically serves a **random dog GIF** from a **dockerized MySQL database** every time the page is refreshed. It also keeps track of visitor count by another MySQL table. The GitHub Actions flow ensures every code update is **built and pushed to Docker Hub**, then tested with docker compose and is deployed to a K8S cluster. To manage the infrastructure efficiently, **Terraform** is used to provision the **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster**, while **AWS S3 and DynamoDB** are leveraged for Backend-Terraform state management. Additionally, **Helm** is used widely for managing Kubernetes deployments, making it easier to deploy, update, and maintain the applications in this project.

### **CI/CD Flow Breakdown**  

1. **Code Push & CI/CD Pipeline Trigger**  
   When new code is pushed to the app/ path in the repository, GitHub Actions automatically detects the change and triggers the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that every update follows a structured, automated deployment process.  

2. **Building the Docker Image**  
   The pipeline starts by building a new Docker image of the Flask application. This image encapsulates all necessary dependencies and configurations, along with the updated code, ensuring a consistent runtime environment across deployments. The Dockerfile is used as a "recipe" to wrap the application and pack it as a docker image.  

3. **Pushing the Image to Docker Hub**  
   Once the Docker image is successfully built, it is pushed to Docker Hub, a public cloud container registry. Storing the image in Docker Hub will allow pulling it later on. Each flow run has a different github run-number used to tag the image that is pushed on every run. This way its easy to pull the image later by specifying its version, enabling stable version - management. 

4. **Testing with Docker Compose**  
   Before deploying to the production environment, a local test is executed using Docker Compose. This ensures that the containerized application runs as expected with no critical errors - before being deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. The test includes a curl to the flask app in order to verify the application is running correctly, sending a HTTP request to the app exposed port, 5000.

5. **Updating the Helm Chart**  
   After passing the test phase, the pipeline then uses Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm defines the application's infrastructure and configuration settings that will be deployed to the cluster as kubernetes manifests. Before packing, the github run-number, that is the same number in which the updated docker image is tagged - is inserted to the chart to ensure that later this image will be used to upgrade the helm release. The updated chart is packed and pushed to github pages helm repository. This step ensures that the latest updated chart is always available to install for deployment.

6. **Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**  
   Terraform manages the Kubernetes infrastructure by provisioning and maintaining the GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster, ensuring scalability and consistency. The tfstate file, which tracks resource states, is stored remotely in an S3 backend for centralized state management. To prevent conflicts in concurrent deployments, Terraform uses DynamoDB for state locking, ensuring only one operation modifies the infrastructure at a time.

7. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
   Once the infrastructure is set up, Helm deploys or upgrades a release in the Kubernetes cluster using the latest Helm chart version, which includes the newly built image. Since the Chart.yaml version is incremented and the updated image tag is pushed to values.yaml on every run, helm upgrade ensures that the new release is fully applied, replacing outdated resources with the latest configuration and container image.  

8. **Exposing Metrics with Prometheus & Monitoring**  
   Once deployed, the application not only serves random dog GIFs but also exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics. These metrics include visitor counts and other key performance indicators, allowing real-time monitoring of the application's usage, health and stats. Prometheus continuously scrapes the application's exposed metrics, providing real-time insights into its behavior. These insights are visualized using monitoring tool Grafana, which is allowing a graphical user-friendly performance analysis.  

9. **Continuous Logging and Issue Detection with Loki**
Loki, a log aggregation system designed for Kubernetes, is deployed using Helm to enhance observability.
Once deployed, Loki collects logs from the running application and other Kubernetes components, allowing for centralized log storage and easy retrieval. These logs are then accessible through Grafana, enabling real-time log analysis, troubleshooting, and debugging. This way, the system ensures that any errors, anomalies, or unexpected behaviors in the application can be quickly identified and addressed, improving reliability and maintainability.  

**This pipeline ensures that every code change is built, tested, validated, and deployed automatically while maintaining observability and infrastructure consistency.**

## üßπ Cleanup  

To keep the environment clean and avoid unnecessary storage costs, several cleanup processes are included in the project:  

### üóëÔ∏è Docker Hub Image Cleanup  

Over time, multiple Docker images can accumulate in **Docker Hub**, leading to unnecessary storage usage. To manage this, a **Docker Hub tags cleanup script** is included in the `cleanups/` directory. This script helps **remove outdated or untagged images** to keep your repository organized.  

To execute the cleanup script:  

```sh
bash cleanups/docker-hub-cleanup.sh
```

Ensure you have **Docker Hub credentials** set up to authenticate with the Docker API before running the script.  

### üóëÔ∏è Helm Chart Cleanup in GitHub Pages Helm Repo  

Helm charts used for deploying the application are stored in a **Helm repository hosted on GitHub Pages**. Over time, as updates are made, older chart versions can accumulate, leading to clutter and unnecessary storage usage.  

To clean up old Helm chart versions, a **bash script is provided in the `cleanups/` directory**. This script:  

- Fetches a list of all Helm chart versions stored in the GitHub Pages repo.  
- Identifies older versions based on a retention policy (e.g., keep only the latest N versions).  
- Removes outdated charts to free up space while ensuring recent versions remain available for deployments.  

To execute the Helm chart cleanup script:  

```sh
bash cleanups/helm-repo-cleanup.sh
```

This helps maintain a **lean and organized Helm repository** while ensuring that deployments always use the most recent stable versions of the charts.
